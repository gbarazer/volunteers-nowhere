  Nowhere Volunteers and Participants Code of Conduct
  -------------

  Nowhere requires hundreds of participants to make it into the wonderful event
  it is. To ensure that Nowhere is a safe, supportive and inclusive environment
  for everyone who attends, this code of conduct sets clear standards for what
  is expected of you while at Nowhere with regards to conduct and behaviour.
  This code of conduct is applicable while attending the event and/or carrying
  out a volunteer's role.

  Standards:

  - Be respectful of each other: Try to understand each other's cultures,
    opinions, and motivations. Respect each other's rights and treat people with
    the same respect and dignity you would want from them.

  - Communicate and collaborate: We are a community of many
    languages, sometimes it can be hard to join a conversation or feel part
    of the event. Try your best to find inclusive ways to communicate with
    each other, and include others and collaborate in your projects and
    work.

  - Be considerate: We all have good and bad days, sometimes we
    laugh and sometimes we cry. Try to support your fellow participants and
    volunteers through the good and the bad.

  - Take Care: Nowhere can be a dangerous and harsh environment, take care to look
    after yourself and think about your safety and the safety of others.

  - Leave No Trace: Please set an example for others at the event, leave no trace, help keep
    the Nowhere site clean, tell everyone why being part of a leave no trace
    event is so important. Help us look after Nowhere for years to come.

  - Consent: Everyone has different boundaries and not all of us like physical or
    intimate contact. Please respect each other's personal space and boundaries.
    Consent should be sought and given prior to touching.

  These behaviours are unacceptable and will not be tolerated:

  - Name calling, verbal abuse or bullying
  - Physical or mental abuse or harassment, hostile behaviour, actions outside
    of people's' comfort zones, threatening behaviour, or the use of weapons
  - Sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, inappropriate physical contact,
    unwelcome sexual attention, or any non-consensual physical interaction
  - Discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, race, religion, gender,
    disability, age or any other distinction
  - Stealing or any form of theft
  - Physical assault

  Being in an inebriated state will not excuse a person from their actions
  if they decide to act outside the code of conduct.

  Any volunteer feeling harassed or put in a compromising situation should
  report their situation to the Human Resources department, their work
  lead, or a MetaLead. If the incident occurs during the event, contact
  the Nomads or Malfare Shift Lead who will help with the matter in a
  private and respectful manner.

  Onsite pre-event participants against whom a complaint has been made
  will meet with the reporting parties and an independent party. The
  independent party will be present to listen to the complaint in order
  that the incident be considered impartially, shortly after any alleged
  incidents.

  All issues will be dealt with in a fair and unbiased manner. However, if
  a participant is found to have broken a code of conduct intentionally,
  or if the violation is egregious, one or more of the following actions
  may be taken:

  - Removal from work duty
  - If during setup or strike -- asked to leave site until the start of the event
  - If a site-eviction process is carried out, the implicated parties must leave the event.

  If there is a criminal incident, for example, a sexual or physical
  assault, the local law enforcement may be contacted, per existing
  protocols. Nothing above will prevent legal action depending on the
  incident.
